Cloud computing is the delivery of technology services - including compute, storage, databases, networking, software, and many more - over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 
So, rather than owning your own computing infrastructure or data centers, you can rent access to these different services from a cloud service provider, like Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. 

Cloud:
1. Scalable
2. Fast set-up speed
3. Pay-as-you-go
On-premise:

1. Less scalable
2. Takes time to set up
3. Ongoing costs
