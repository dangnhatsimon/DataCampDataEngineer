The three basic ones are compute, storage, and databases. 
Compute objects are the brains that will process your workload, like the server in the web hosting example from before. 
Storage resources help you save and store data, like images and files. 
Databases store more structured sets of data. 

Cloud computing characteristics:
1. Virtualization is the fundamental technology that powers cloud computing. 
It splits a physical server into several virtual servers, each running their own independent operating system. 
Not only will this allow a more efficient use of the physical resources available, it also abstracts the physical layer from the virtualized machine, making it more portable and easier to manage in a cloud environment. 
This reduces the need for physical machines and maximizes the output of individual servers, allowing cloud providers to operate on economies of scale.

2. Scalability - you can easily add and remove resources as you need them.

3. Scalability. Vertical scaling allows you to change the power of your existing instance. You could get a more powerful server for example. 
With horizontal scaling, you are simply increasing the number of instances you're using, sharing the workload across multiple devices.

4. Cost -you only pay for what you use

5. Speed - on-demand resourcing. The cloud makes resources available to you almost immediately when you ask for them. 


6. Performance - 

7. Growth - Because of the on-demand resourcing, growth constraints are significantly reduced. 
You can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes. 

8. Reliability - Cloud computing ensures the durability and availability of your data and services. 
This is possible because the data is purposely replicated at multiple redundant data centers in the cloud provider's network.

9. Security - When choosing for a cloud solution, you are trusting an external party to keep your data secure.
