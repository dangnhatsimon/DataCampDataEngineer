PaaS: Platform as a Service. As well as the underlying infrastructure, this will include the tools and software that developers need to build applications on top of: that could include operating systems, middleware, and runtime. 
PaaS provides hardware and software tools over the internet that people can use to develop applications. 
Developers donâ€™t need to start from scratch when creating applications, saving a lot of time on writing extensive code.
Users: developers.

SaaS: Software-as-a-Service.  The underlying hardware and operating system is irrelevant to the end user, who will access the service via a web browser or app.
