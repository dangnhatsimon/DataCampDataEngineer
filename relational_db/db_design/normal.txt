Normal forms (NF):
1. First normal form (1NF)
2. Second normal form (2NF)
3. Third normal form (3NF)
4. Elementary key normal form (EKNF)
5. Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)
6. Fourth normal form (4NF)
7. Fourth normal form (4NF)
8. Essential tupple normal form (ETNF)
9. Fifth normal form (5NF)
10. Domain- key normal form (5NF)
11. Sixth normal form (6NF)

First normal form (1NF):
Each record must be unique - no duplicate rows
Each cell must hold one value

Second normal form (2NF):
Satisfy 1NF and:
If primary key is one column then automatically satisfies 2NF
If thre is a composite primary key then each non key column must be dependent on all the keys

Third normal form (3NF):
Satisfies 2NF
No transitive dependencies: non key columns can't depend on other non key columns.
