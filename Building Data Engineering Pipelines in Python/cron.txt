Oftentimes we have tasks that need to run on a schedule. Churn prediction algorithms might need to be run weekly for example. 
An often used software utility in such cases is “cron”. 
Cron reads configuration files, known as “crontab” files. 
In these files, you tabulate tasks that you want to run at a specific time. 
Here’s an example. 

*/15 9-17 * * 1-3,5 log_my_activity
# minutes   hours   days    months days of the week    command

This crontab record would execute the process “log_my_activity” at a specific time, which, read from left to right, would mean:
every 15 minutes,
between normal office hours,
every day of the month,
for every month,
but only Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
